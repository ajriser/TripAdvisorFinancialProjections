Valuation Summary 
 
The share price for TripAdvisor was calculated under the different valuation models. From these analyses, we can see that the stock is slightly undervalued at $28.78. The Discounted Free Cash Flow analysis shows that the price should be $31.60. From sensitivity analysis, it is possible to conclude that most combinations yielded a higher share price than the actual one, although the simulation does not provide a statistical significance to determine if the stock is in fact undervalued it has a higher probability of being undervalued than overvalued since the actual stock price is less than the mean of this distribution. 
 
Recommendation and Bottom line 
 
When their share prices are undervalued, firms have a choice of buying back stocks or disclosing critical information. TripAdvisor pays no dividends and have been practicing stock repurchase. These choices represent a tradeoff between the interests of short-term investors and long-term investors. 
 
Although the different models yielded higher stock prices than the actual stock price leading to believe that the stock is undervalued. The margins were too thin, and no statistical significance could be established through the simulation. 
 
Given that Trip Advisor’s stock has been consistently losing value since 2014, the effect of COVID in traveling is still ongoing and there is no clear sight of when operations would go back to normal, and that also, Trip Advisor has not been able to reinvent themselves during the pandemic this study concludes that the investor should not buy this stock. 
 
A better option in December of 2020 would be to short this stock as there is no clear sight of the stock going up and multiple factors for its value to go down.
